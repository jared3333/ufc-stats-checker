Grade:
I think my main is worth 40, but I did not do a testing program, so that is obviously worth 0.
I have a total of 4 is-a relationships, and 8 has-a relationships. I think that these are mostly
unique and complex enough to be worth 20 points each, but the TitleFight / NonTitleFight classes
are not working correctly, so maybe only one of those two is worth 20 points.

I use file input to read the data in, so that is also worth 10 points.

As far as deductions, I think my style is not that good, but I made my first commit 
last Monday, and my video is decent, so I am hoping for 5 points of deductions

Overall I think my grade could be 260.
